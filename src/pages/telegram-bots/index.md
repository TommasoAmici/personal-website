## Bot to repost goals from /r/soccer

Uses Reddit's and Telegram's APIs to find the replays of each Serie A team. [Github.](https://github.com/TommasoAmici/r_soccer_goals)

I can vouch for these two libraries:

- [`praw`](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for Reddit
- [`python-telegram-bot`](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) for Telegram

Something I also recently learned is that you can use `youtube-dl` in Python (I only ever used it in the CLI).
