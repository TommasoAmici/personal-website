I'm an economist turned software developer, which in hindsight I should've been from the beginning.
Perhaps I'll write a post-mortem of my studies in the future.

As far as software goes, I'm a good Python and Javascript developer, and in the future I'd like to either improve my C or to pick up C++ for systems programming, and more intensive tasks.
While I could see myself as a backend developer, at the moment I'm more confident in my frontend skills.

I've also always been keen on design, and I think I have developed a good eye for it, despite my lack of formal training.
